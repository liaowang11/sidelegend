SideLegend from Bottle
>Bottle used jQuery. However, on Octopress, the builtin library is under control of ender.js.
>So, I did a little modification and it works on ender.js with Bonzo and Bean.
>I'm so lazy to get Emile(the animation part for ender.js), so just crafted to use HTML5. Rock!

*Noted: I got this issue saying the event.layerX is deprecated on webkit.Wondering if Bean is using the old API?
