SideLegend from Bottle
>Bottle used jQuery. However, on Octopress, the builtin library is under control of ender.js.
>So, I did a little modification and it works on ender.js with Bonzo and Bean.

*Noted: I got this issue saying the event.layerX is deprecated on webkit.</br>Wondering if Bean is using the old API?
